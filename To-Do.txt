TO-DO List

_________________________________________________________________________________________

Navigation Bar:

- Correct button alignment : "our galleries" & "our artists" should be centered and lower

- Enlarge Bar height : Make the bar larger to fit "The Gallery Walk" logo better

- Update navigation bar for gallery and artist login: They should look like _Layout by having only a gallery and artist directory

- Text color : The menu buttons change to white when hovered over, 
	they should get a blue highlight with an underline like "The Gallery Walk" button 

- Nav Bar border : Remove the black line at the bottom of the bar in the live website

- Fix the mobile dropdown menu alignment : The Artsy portal menu option is laying out 
	to the left, it should be centered
		
- Update the hamburger icon colors : the hamburger icon should be borderless with 3 
	dark grey bars that highlight to grey when hovered over
		
- Fix the right gear cog icon to a dark grey color

- Move the "About us" link to the bottom of the page below the footer so it's out of the 
	way


*** These changes should be applied to all 3 layouts ***

Entity Collections:

- Update the other controllers collections to use the new PageManager, the entity already has a PageManager in it's base
	class, so you should have to configure it in the controller and create the page view in the cshmtl file.
	check out the gallery directory and gallery information view to see how it's configured

- Fix layout issues by enforcing an image size and cropping to maintain aspect ratio.
	you can see the problem by changing the PageManager default page item size by
	assigning pageItemCount in setDefaultValues of the PageManager Entity. This 
	updates the number of entities displayed for all Collections using it

 Views:

 - go through the artist and artwork information view and create one version that enables the logged in user 
 	to edit the artist or artwork, the logged in user should be the file owner, other users should be directed
 	to another information view that does not have the ability to edit.
 	* we need to figure out a nice way to present the editing options, they should be hidden until needed and appealing
 		when it is visible, the current way is just a place holder.
	* Make sure there is a check for file owner before allowing updating.
	
 - Update the information views to place a larger focus on the images, the information for the entity should be below it.
 
 - A Home view, maybe a nice collection of images cropped to form a clickable wall of random galleries, artist users
 	and artworks 
 	
 - A new artist portal, the current one doesn't look nice.
 
 - About us/contact view
