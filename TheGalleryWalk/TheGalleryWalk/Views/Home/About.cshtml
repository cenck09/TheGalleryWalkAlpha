            Our client is involved in the art world and has a great interest in supporting local art galleries.
            However, small business owners have a difficult time standing out from larger companies that have all the resources
            they need for advertising in order to be successful. Our client has proposed a web service to give small business
            owners a digital storefront to display all of their artwork online.
            The web service will need a website to display the art galleries artwork to any users, and have a secure login for gallery owners to add and update new artwork.
