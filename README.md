#### ASP .NET Resources

#### GitFlow cheatsheet
 This is a nifty refrence to gitflow commands [here](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/).
Since we're building this with the agile methodology we need to maintain working code at all times for when Chang wants to see the progress.
Whenever you begin working on a feature, make sure to create a new branch with develop as the base. 
The master branch will maintain a working version for us at all times.
When you have finished working on a feature make a pull request for everyone to review the changes before merging.
